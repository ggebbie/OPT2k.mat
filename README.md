OPT2k requires the TMI package v.0.8.2 or greater. You can clone it
manually with `git clone https://github.com/ggebbie/TMI` or follow the
MATLAB scripts. If TMI already exists in your configuration, the code
will not check for the latest version, but it may be required for
consistency.

Code has been tested for MATLAB version 9.10.0.1602886 (R2021a).
